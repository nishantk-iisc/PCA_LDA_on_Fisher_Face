15 subject faces with happy/sad emotions are provided in the data. Each image is of a 100x100 matrix. Perform PCA to reduce the dimension from 10000 to K (using PCA for high dimensional data) and then perform LDA to one dimension. Plot the one-dimensional features for each image. Select the optimum threshold to classify the emotion and report the classification accuracy on the test data. What is the best choice of K which gives the maximum separability?
